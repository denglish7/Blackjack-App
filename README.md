# Final Project

### I created a multiplayer blackjack game. Users can create a username to log in and are taken through a few onboarding slides that they can skip. Once in the main lobby, users can hit start game to play against the dealer or they can wait for other users to join as well. The game starts by prompting everyone to submit a bet by clicking on the available amounts. Once all users have placed their bets, the cards are dealt. Then all players take turns hitting, staying, or doubling down. Once all players are done, the dealer will hit until they reach at least 17. The game then completes by determining which players won and which players lost and allocating the chips. Users can also chat to each other using the chat box.

### As the logic of the game was more than I was planning for, I did need to limit myself with certain constraints. For example, I decided to design the game only for playing on a desktop/laptop with a large screen instead of making it responsive for all devices. Perhaps later I will work more on that. In terms of the outcomes of past games being saved, users can continue to play additional hands and their chip totals are saved. However, no other data is saved once a player leaves. Finally, I had planned on adding animation to my app, as I think it would add a lot, but time constraints forced me to skip that as well.
